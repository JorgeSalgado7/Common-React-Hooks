# Common React Hooks

React Hooks I usually use for web development in .js and .ts version

## useField
This hook allows the user to work with input properties, without using useState or useReducer Hook.

It can handle:
- name
- placeholder
- id
- set / change current value


## useViewHeight
Combine with css, it resize the browser height to set correctly the 100vh property in modern browsers.
